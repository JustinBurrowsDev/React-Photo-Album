## Challenges I Faced? 

I was very excited to move into react, I've been told by many developers who are currently active in the industry. Although I studied JavaScript prior to this, some of the rules and syntax of react are currently in bit esoteric nature. In particular JSX Elements and their proper format. However they use in theory does seem straightforward but currently at this time the topic and the associated learning curve is brand new.

## How Did I Over Come Those Challenges?

I'm really thankful that there is really good documentation online as well as a plethora of people with online YouTube channels willing to teach the topic. I was able to get a handle on JSX elements through the use of these mediums and through collaboration with my peers I became more confident in the application of them and their best use cases. 

## What Did I Learn? 

* Reinforced HTML
* Practiced CSS Layout
* Sharpen Javascript Fundamentals
* Deepened Knowledge on React
* Increased Knowledge on React Router
